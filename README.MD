Please keep in mind this is my first android app.
I would love feedback regardless of whether I continue in the interview process.

Written for API 25... see gradle build. Things are a bit messier than I would have liked  but I cleaned and commented as much as I could.
It works. I would think its best to import it into android studio and run it on an emulator through the IDE.

I need to give credit to www.vogella.com/tutorials/AndroidListView/article.html
